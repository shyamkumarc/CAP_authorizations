# SAP CAP Nodejs Authorisation example
All credits to : https://github.com/jowavp/SAP-CAPM-Nodejs-Authorisation-example

Only minor corrections in Package.json of SRV and root folders to accomodate the node versions and  CDS version to prevent certain dependancy errors .

The blog for this code can be found in : https://blogs.sap.com/2019/10/24/test-your-cap-nodejs-applications-with-authentication-locally/

And note that the blog doesnt speak of adding the roles specific to this app  to a role collection adn assigning it to a user , which is covered pretty clear in 
the CAP official documentation  : https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/authentication#jwt (section : Set Up the Roles for the Application )
